SERVICES=... localstack start The environment variable SERVICES is a comma-separated list of services (see available services here). We recommend limiting the list of services to start up (e.g., SERVICES=lambda,s3,cognito,rds), to keep a low memory footprint and optimize performance.
Please note: Starting with version 0.11.0, all services are exposed via a single edge service endpoint - http://localhost:4566 by default. (The old service-specific port numbers from previous releases are now deprecated and disabled.</description></item><item><title>Configuration</title><link>https://localstack.cloud/docs/getting-started/configuration/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Jun 2021 12:58:30 +0200</pubDate><guid>https://localstack.cloud/docs/getting-started/configuration/</guid><description>For a list of general configuration options for LocalStack, please refer to the README in the public Github repo.
Additionally, LocalStack Pro provides the following configurations that can be set as environment variables:
DNS_ADDRESS: IP address that the local DNS server should be bound to (default: 0.0.0.0). Can be configured to avoid port clashes in case a DNS server is already running on localhost port 53. Set to 0 or false to avoid exposing DNS port altogether.</description></item></channel></rss>
